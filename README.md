# Harmoni-US

This product recognizes chords from a voice or an instrument and generates real-time harmony to the melody presented based on the key. Using Pure Data to detect the pitch, it transposes the audio input a specific amount of semitones in order to create a minor/ major chord. Depending on the key and type of scale, each note must be transposed a different amount, so the intervals are mapped between each note in the melody with its respective harmony depending on the type of scale. Then, an algorithm equalizes each key so that each transposition maps accurately based on which note in the key is being sung/played. Now, the artist can select their key before hand and the harmonies will generate accurately.
